// Uploads one file to Cloudflare R2 (via the S3 API) at an exact key, refusing to overwrite.
//
// WHY R2 RATHER THAN VERCEL BLOB
// This replaces blob-put.mjs. R2 charges nothing for egress, and serving an installer is almost
// entirely egress: every download of a ~30 MB file is bandwidth. On Vercel Blob that came out of
// a metered Pro allowance; on R2 it is free, and the storage sits inside R2's standing free tier.
// The public URL is served from the bucket's custom domain (dl.thelongviewapp.com), which is a
// direct, non-redirecting, permanent link, exactly what Partner Center requires.
//
// THE ONE OPTION THAT IS NOT A DEFAULT, AND WHY
//   no overwrite: publishing the same commit sha twice FAILS rather than silently replacing a
//                 package that may already be submitted. Partner Center caches what it fetched,
//                 so the same URL quietly meaning something different later is the failure mode
//                 worth refusing outright. Matches blob-put's allowOverwrite:false.
//
// The URL is NOT printed here. It is deterministic (custom domain + key), so the caller composes
// it from the same key rather than parsing it back out of an upload log.
//
// Usage: node r2-put.mjs <file> <key>
