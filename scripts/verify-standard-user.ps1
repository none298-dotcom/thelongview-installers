# Proves that a standard, NON-ADMIN user can see and open what was just installed.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# Every other check in this workflow runs as `runneradmin`, and so does every check anybody has
# ever run on this app by hand: the developer's own machine, a local VM, this runner. All of them
# are the administrator. That is the one account for which a per-user install looks perfectly fine.
#
# The failure it is written for is the one the certifier actually performs: install elevated, then
# come back as an ordinary user and try to use the thing. If the payload landed in the installing
# administrator's profile, the ordinary user sees nothing at all, and the report says the app
# cannot be launched. The 10.1.2.10 assertion already catches the common shape of that by looking
# at WHERE the shortcut went. This asks the question the other way round, from the account that
# actually has something to lose, and it catches shapes a path check cannot: a shortcut in the
# right place pointing at a binary the user cannot read, an install directory whose ACL never
# granted Users traverse, a target that does not exist.
#
# WHY IT DOES NOT LAUNCH THE GUI AS THAT USER
# It was the obvious first draft and it is a false-red machine. `Start-Process -Credential` runs
# the new process on its own window station, so a Compose Desktop window has no interactive
# desktop to draw on and dies for reasons that have nothing to do with the installer. A red that
# means "CI could not show a window" teaches nobody anything and gets ignored, which is worse than
# no check. The GUI is already launched and clicked, as admin, by the steps around this one.
#
# So the probe is a CONSOLE script run genuinely as the standard user, writing its findings to a
# file the caller reads back. Headless, deterministic, and it still runs under that user's token
# and that user's ACL evaluation, which is the whole point.
#
# HOW TO SEE IT GO RED
# `-f break_mode=per_user_install`. That installs into the administrator's profile, so the
# standard user cannot reach the binary and every assertion below fails at once. Do that before
# believing a green from this script.
