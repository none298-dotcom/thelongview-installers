# Clicks the installed app's primary button and proves the click did something.
#
# WHY NOT UI AUTOMATION
# UIA was asked what it could see inside the window. The answer was the window and one nameless
# Pane: Compose Desktop draws through Skia and, without the Java Access Bridge, publishes no
# semantics tree, so there is no element to find by name and no InvokePattern to call. (That is
# an accessibility defect in its own right, recorded separately. It is not this script's job.)
#
# What is left is what a person does: move the real mouse, press, and look at the screen.
#
# HOW A DEAD BUTTON IS CAUGHT
# By comparing pixels before and after. A button whose handler never runs leaves the screen
# identical. That comparison only means something if "identical" is achievable, so a NEGATIVE
# CONTROL runs first: a click on empty background, which must produce NO change. If it does
# produce one, the screen is repainting on its own, a later "it changed" would prove nothing,
# and the script fails rather than reporting a green it has not earned.
#
# TWO MISTAKES THIS SCRIPT ALREADY MADE, both of which reported a dead button that was not dead
#  1. It measured GetWindowRect. On Windows 10 and later that includes the invisible DWM resize
#     border, so the grab had a strip of DESKTOP WALLPAPER along the bottom: a full width band of
#     non background colour, which the button finder happily selected and clicked. Everything is
#     measured from the CLIENT rect now, which is the app and nothing else.
#  2. It assumed the primary button spans the window. It does not. The onboarding content sits in
#     a readable measure about 465px wide inside an 1100px window, and the button matches it, so
#     a "must be wider than half the window" rule excluded the real button and preferred the
#     window-wide artefact above.
# The lesson in both: a button finder that can latch onto scenery will, and it fails in the
# direction that looks like a product defect. Hence the vertical thickness requirement below,
# which scenery does not have.
