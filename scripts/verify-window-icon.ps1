# Asserts the window's title bar icon is the app's own icon.
#
# WHY THIS CHECK EXISTS
# The packaged Windows build shipped with the stock Java placeholder in its title bar and in
# Alt+Tab. The owner has failed store submissions over exactly this before. It was found by a
# human looking at a screenshot; nothing here caught it.
#
# It hid well. jpackage's `iconFile` sets the icon on the EXE, the Start Menu shortcut and the
# taskbar button, so every surface the packaging config reaches was already correct and looked
# right in a desktop screenshot. The window's own icon is the one surface it does not reach:
# that comes from the toolkit, and Compose falls back to AWT's default when the app does not
# set one.
#
# HOW IT IS CHECKED
# Against the app's OWN shipped EXE icon rather than against a hardcoded colour or a checked in
# reference image. The rule being encoded is "the title bar shows the same icon as the
# application", so comparing the two is the check, and it keeps working when the artwork is
# redesigned. A hardcoded swatch would have to be updated with every icon change, and would go
# green on the day someone forgot.
#
# Both icons are also saved as artifacts, because the eye is the final authority here.

# WHAT IS COMPARED, AND WHY NOT THE OBVIOUS THINGS
# Not pixel by pixel. The window icon comes back as a 16x16 that Windows scales up, drawn small
# inside its frame, while the EXE icon is a crisp full bleed 32x32. Identical artwork through
# those two paths measured 44.7 mean per channel difference, against 64.8 for the actual Java
# placeholder. Real separation, but far too little headroom to sit a threshold in.
#
# Not a structural hash either. That was tried and came out BACKWARDS: 53 of 64 bits differing
# for the correct icon versus 38 for the wrong one, because the padding difference wrecks shape
# agreement even when the image is the same. Had it been trusted, it would have failed the good
# build and passed the bad one.
#
# What does separate them is the average colour of the artwork itself, ignoring the padding:
# 15.7 for the correct icon, 39.7 for the Java placeholder. The app mark is warm cream and gold,
# the placeholder is grey and blue, and scaling does not change that.
